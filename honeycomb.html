            <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup golden syrup</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons water/li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>paper, making sure the parchment sides reach at least 2 inches above the sides of the baking sheet. Grease parchment with butter.</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, golden syrup, water, and vanilla extract in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil, but do not stir. Heat to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads, about 10 minutes. Brush the sides of the pan with a clean pastry brush dipped in water if any sugar crystals form on the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and carefully add baking soda; stir quickly until foaming subsides and mixture turns golden. Pour into the prepared baking pan immediately. Cool until set, about 15 minutes. Break into bite-size chunks to serve.</li>
        </ol>
